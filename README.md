This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

A learning project to practice React and making requests with third-party APIs. The end goal is a restaurant recommendation website that allows users to search for local businesses based on their location and keywords. Using a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and the Yelp API, the end application replicates the core functionality of Yelp.

## To Run This Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Which runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This project also requires an API key for the Yelp API, available through Yelp after registering your application as a developer.

## Project Development Requirements
✓ Build the restaurant recommendation application using React<br>
✓ Utilize HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of the tech stack<br>
✓ Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub<br>

## Technologies Used
HTML/CSS<br>
JavaScript<br>
React<br>
HTTP Requests and Responses<br>
Authentication<br>

## Services Used
Yelp

## Project Features
✓ Users can query for a restaurant based on their location, and sort it by best match, highest rated, and most reviewed<br>
✓ Users can view a list of businesses that match their query, sorted by best match, highest rated, or most reviews<br>
✓ Users can repeatedly make multiple queries for a restaurant recommendation<br>

## Future Work
* Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab
* Make images clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab
* Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again
* Allow you to search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”) on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking
* Add autocompletion of addresses to the “Location” input
* Add autocompletion of businesses to the "Businesses" input
